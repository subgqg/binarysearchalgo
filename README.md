# binarysearchalgo
This code is an implementation of a binary search algorithm in Python. The algorithm is used to search for a specific element in a sorted array or list. The code starts by declaring a list of integers, in this case 'list=[2,5,8,12,23]'. The user is prompted to enter a number they want to search for, which is assigned to the variable 'a'. The variable 'u' is assigned the length of the list and the variable 'l' is initialized to 0.

The code then enters into a while loop with the condition 'l<u'. Inside the while loop, the variable 'm' is assigned the value of '(l+u)//2', which is the middle index of the current search range. The if statement checks if the middle element of the array is the same as the element the user is searching for. If this is the case, the code prints the message "Found at" along with the position of the element in the list and the loop breaks.

If the middle element is not the desired element, the code checks whether the desired element is greater than or less than the middle element. If the desired element is greater than the middle element, the lower bound of the search range is set to the middle index. If the desired element is less than the middle element, the upper bound of the search range is set to the middle index. The while loop continues until the desired element is found or the lower bound becomes greater than
